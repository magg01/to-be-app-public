# To-be app
## Description
A cross-platform, mindful, task management app built with Expo and React Native.

The ‘To-be list’ app is not a typical task management app in that it doesn’t focus on organising your chores or work-based tasks. Instead, the app looks at tasks from an angle of *being* rather than *doing* for bettering your well-being, fulfilment and self-actualisation. The app promotes a sense of working on oneself rather than for somebody or something else.
